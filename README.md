**Project Title:**  DEPLOYING AN APPLICATION WITH DATABASE USING AWS ELASTIC BEANSTALK   

**Industry Name:** AWS


**Problem Statement/Opportunity:** Organizations need reliable, scalable, and easily deployable solutions to manage applications and databases efficiently. AWS Elastic Beanstalk offers a powerful way to deploy, manage, and scale web applications with built-in integration for database services. This project focuses on deploying an application on Elastic Beanstalk with a backend database, aiming to demonstrate seamless deployment, easy scaling, and robust database management.

**Project Description:** This project involved deploying a fully functional web application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with an integrated database. Elastic Beanstalk automates the infrastructure management, reducing manual configurations and allowing focus on application development. The setup includes configuring the environment for the application, establishing a database connection, and deploying the codebase. Elastic Beanstalkâ€™s features like automated scaling, load balancing, and health monitoring are used to optimize the application performance and manage the database integration smoothly.
